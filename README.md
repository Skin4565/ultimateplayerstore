ABOUT PLUGIN

When I played on servers I always created my store to have more money on the server ...

But over time I stopped playing on servers and started working on my own server

Thinking of the many experiences I spent playing began to create my own plugins. So I thought my players would create stores

for other players to buy your items

In this I created the UltimatePlayerStore a store creation plugin

It has many systems .... Reading the topic you would know more

With a simple system it its use and intuitive ie the use is easy ...
